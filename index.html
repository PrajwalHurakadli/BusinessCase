        <!-- Overview Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The rise of e-commerce and online services has made the delivery industry a vital part of daily life. From postal services to grocery and food delivery, optimizing operations through efficient algorithms can help enhance performance, minimize costs, and improve customer satisfaction. In this case study, we explore the application of algorithms such as Dijkstra’s algorithm, Priority Queue (Min-Heap), Floyd-Warshall, and others to optimize Postal, Newspaper, Courier, and Grocery Delivery Services.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Postal and Newspaper Delivery -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Postal Service and Newspaper Delivery Service</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Postal and newspaper delivery services are crucial for ensuring that letters, parcels, and newspapers are delivered efficiently to the right locations. However, these services face challenges in terms of optimizing delivery routes and reducing delivery times.</p>

            <h3>Case 1: Shortest Path for Delivery (Dijkstra's Algorithm / Floyd-Warshall)</h3>
            <p>One of the most important problems in postal and newspaper delivery services is finding the shortest path between delivery points. This helps reduce delivery time, fuel consumption, and operational costs.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To find the shortest path between a delivery point and the destination, we can use Dijkstra’s Algorithm or Floyd-Warshall Algorithm. Dijkstra’s algorithm is ideal for finding the shortest path from a single source, while Floyd-Warshall computes shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, which is useful for city-wide delivery planning.</p>

            <h3>Case 2: Parcel Prioritization and Sorting (Priority Queue / Min-Heap)</h3>
            <p>Parcel prioritization is key to ensuring that urgent deliveries are handled first. By efficiently sorting parcels based on their priority, we can reduce delays and ensure that the most important items reach their destination promptly.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Instead of traditional sorting algorithms like Merge Sort, we use a **Priority Queue (Min-Heap)** to prioritize parcels. In this system, parcels with higher priority are processed first. The Priority Queue allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the highest-priority items. This method ensures that parcels are sorted dynamically as new deliveries come in.</p>

        <!-- Techniques Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Techniques</h2>
            <h3>The main Newspaper Agency delivers the newspaper stock to clusters, then from clusters the delivery boys deliver them</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Divide the city into clusters of homes (e.g., groups of 10-20 homes in nearby areas).</li>
                <li><strong>Central Nodes:</strong> Use distribution centers or key nodes within each cluster to distribute newspapers or posts to the homes in that cluster.</li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical Delivery:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>For Newspapers:</strong> Newspapers are delivered daily from the main depot to central nodes (called clusters, similar to CDN networks like Netflix or YouTube), and from there to individual homes.</li>
                        <li><strong>For Postal Service:</strong> Posts are first sent to regional distribution centers (2-3 days), and then routed to clusters for final delivery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Parallel Processing:</strong> Delivery happens simultaneously across clusters, reducing overall delivery time.</li>
            </ul>
